# Security and Privacy Documentation

This document outlines the security and privacy measures implemented in the EphemeralShare application to ensure safety for all users, including administrators.

## Privacy by Design

### 1. Ephemeral Data Storage
- Content is automatically deleted after expiration
- No permanent storage of user data
- In-memory storage for development, database storage for production

### 2. History Protection
- Special handling for the /app route to prevent browser history tracking
- Uses history replacement instead of history push for sensitive navigation
- Meta tags to prevent caching and indexing

### 3. No User Tracking
- No user accounts or personal information stored
- No cookies or local storage used for tracking
- No analytics or third-party tracking scripts

## Data Security

### 1. Transport Security
- All data transmission over HTTPS
- Proper CORS headers for API endpoints
- Referrer policy to prevent information leakage

### 2. Content Security
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Optional AI text manipulation for content obfuscation
- No file uploads to prevent malicious content

### 3. API Security
- Rate limiting (handled by Vercel)
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Validation of all API inputs

## Administrator Safety

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive environment variables to version control
- Use .env.example for documentation only
- Vercel dashboard for secure environment variable management

### 2. Access Control
- No administrative interface exposed
- API endpoints are stateless
- No persistent sessions or authentication for admin functions

### 3. Monitoring
- Vercel logs for monitoring application usage
- Database logs for tracking data operations (if using persistent storage)
- Regular security audits of dependencies

## Deployment Security

### 1. Vercel Security Features
- Automatic HTTPS provisioning
- DDoS protection
- Rate limiting
- Secure headers

### 2. Database Security (if using persistent storage)
- Connection pooling
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Regular backups (handled by database provider)

## Best Practices for Administrators

### 1. Regular Maintenance
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor Vercel usage and logs
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Review access logs regularly

### 2. Incident Response
- Procedures for handling security incidents
- Contact information for Vercel support
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 3. Compliance
- GDPR compliance through data minimization
- No personal data storage
- Automatic data deletion

## User Safety Features

### 1. Content Protection
- Automatic expiration of shared content
- No permanent URLs
- View-only access to shared content

### 2. Privacy Controls
- No browser history tracking for sensitive routes
- Cache control to prevent content caching
- No referrer information leakage

### 3. Transparency
- Clear privacy notices
- Open source code for review
- Documentation of all security measures

## Security Testing

### 1. Automated Testing
- TypeScript for compile-time type safety
- Zod for runtime validation
- ESLint for code quality and security checks

### 2. Manual Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Code review procedures
- Security audit of third-party dependencies

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. Do not publicly disclose the issue
2. Contact the project maintainers directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before any disclosure

## Future Security Improvements

Planned security enhancements:
- End-to-end encryption for shared content
- Additional authentication options
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Regular third-party security audits
